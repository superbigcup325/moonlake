# Roadmap

**0.6.0 is accepted locally and unreleased.** All changes since 0.5.0 and the
work below belong to it, and its acceptance checks have cleared (verification
§36); what is left is release work — push, tag, publication and deployment —
which happens only on explicit authorization. Directions waiting for evidence
stay on the hold list until their trigger fires.

## Current implementation

Native CSV and Parquet sources read byte ranges, the native Parquet writer
streams its output, and spill directories are reclaimed when ownership evidence
proves the process is dead. These shipped in 0.5.0. The 0.6.0 changes add files
past 2 GiB, smaller Snappy output, a single-table LIMIT that stops its scan,
checked SQL integer arithmetic, CSV and CLI fixes, and more general correlated
subqueries. [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) lists implemented changes;
[verification](verification.md) records the evidence for each.

Sources read incrementally, and the operators that can work a batch at a time
now do. `execute` and `execute_with` return a complete `SelectResult`; `stream`
and `stream_with` hand out batches instead, and the CLI prints through them, so
a single-table scan with its `WHERE`, projection and `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` window
never holds its result (verification §31). A single-table `GROUP BY` or global
aggregate folds its groups as the scan delivers batches and holds its state
instead of its input (109.7 MB → 35.3 MB of peak RSS over 16 columns and
2,000,000 rows, §32). A spilled `ORDER BY` builds runs from those batches and
hands the merge out as a cursor, owning the run files it writes (506.8 MB →
178.8 MB, §33). A two-table `INNER`/`LEFT`/`FULL` join reads its build side once,
probes a batch at a time and returns the joined rows in batches of at most
4,096, so only the side that has to be resident is (270.8 MB → 35.3 MB, §34).
What still accumulates is listed per shape: a chain of three or more joins, a
`RIGHT` or `SEMI`/`ANTI` join, a keyless cross join, a budgeted `GROUP BY`
(whose grace path sizes its partitions from the input), and anything above those
operators that needs every row first — `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, a
window function, a derived table, a set operation. `--memory` budgets blocking
operators and is not a process RSS cap.

## 0.6.0 delivery plan

The order below is by dependency. R0 fixes the scope, S0 preserves correctness
before another executor change, E3 adds result consumption, and E4 changes one
blocking operator at a time. The existing early-stop measurements, batch
contract and single-table LIMIT implementation cover the earlier E0/E1/E2
milestone; extend them rather than implementing that milestone again. Every task
below, R1 included, is complete on `3ab2634` (verification §36). S0's gate is
`harness/check_correlation.py` with its fixtures, wired into the fixed-case CI
job and the seeded nightly; verification §30 records what it found while being
committed — two wrong answers in three-valued `IN` / `NOT IN` and one shape
whose refusal message is still the binder's. E3's contract is stated in
`engine/stream.mbt` and its evidence in verification §31; E4a's is the same
batch contract one operator further in, and verification §32 records it. E4b's
is a cursor over run files, and verification §33 records it; E4c's is the one
shape whose build side must stay resident, recorded in §34; W0's answer is a
measurement and a decision, and verification §35 records both.

| Task | Delivery | Depends on | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | One unreleased 0.6.0 scope in the changelog, roadmap and handoff | Current-state check | Every pending changelog entry belongs to 0.6.0; implemented work and remaining work have distinct status; the latest published release stays identified as 0.5.0 |
| S0 | Reproducible regression evidence for the latest SQL and CLI changes | R0 | Commit the correlation differential fixtures and runner, including duplicate outer rows, NULLs, empty inputs and deliberate refusals; normalize dates and non-finite values and compare unordered answers as row multisets; an oracle error, missing fixture, wrong answer or zero value cases fails; run fixed cases in CI and add seeded cases to nightly |
| E3 | An additive result-consumption API and a CLI that consumes batches | S0 | **Done** (verification §31): a caller reads the schema and consumes a single-table scan/filter/projection/`OFFSET`-`LIMIT` query batch by batch without collecting it; `execute` / `execute_with` keep their signatures and run the same pull; `close` and a failed pull release the scan; text and JSON output are consumed per batch (a 16-column 2,000,000-row result: 1,090.6 MB → 35.2 MB of peak RSS for `--json`) |
| E4a | Aggregation consumes batches | E3 | **Done** (verification §32): a single-table `GROUP BY` or global aggregate folds the scan's batches as they arrive and never holds its input array; NULL key groups, NULL aggregate inputs, empty inputs and DISTINCT aggregates match the collected answers and the goldens; the counters `--analyze` prints are identical on both paths; a budgeted `GROUP BY` still spills and still matches in-memory answers (16 columns, 2,000,000 rows: 109.7 MB → 35.3 MB of peak RSS) |
| E4b | External sort consumes batches and feeds the result consumer | E3 | **Done** (verification §33): runs are built from the scan's batches, the final merge is a cursor and a sorted stream hands it out a batch at a time, so neither the input array nor the sorted answer is materialized (16 columns, 2,000,000 rows, `select * … order by id`: 506.8 MB → 178.8 MB of peak RSS); ties, NULL order, DISTINCT, OFFSET/LIMIT and the in-memory fallback match the collected answers at four budgets; the run files are removed on exhaustion, on early close and on error; `--analyze` counters and spill bytes are unchanged |
| E4c | Join input and output use the batch contract | E3, established spill lifecycle | **Done** (verification §34): a two-table INNER/LEFT/FULL join streams — `JoinCursor` reads the build side once and probes a batch at a time, the output leaves in batches of at most 4096 rows, and `join_step` runs on the same cursor so the collected and streamed answers cannot diverge; duplicate keys on both sides, empty build and probe sides, LEFT/FULL unmatched rows, residual predicates, NULL keys and an early close are compared against `execute`; the shapes that stay collected are listed and each is pinned by a test (16 columns, 2,000,000 rows probed against a 1,000-row build: 270.8 MB → 35.3 MB of peak RSS, and under `--memory 8M` the grace path is not entered at all, 1.99 s → 0.41 s) |
| W0 | A second dataset tests whether adaptive dictionaries are worth implementing | Fixed comparison inputs; independent of E3/E4 | **Done** (verification §35), and the answer is "not in this release": on a seeded 500,000-row access log a per-column dictionary is worth −14% of the file at our writer's 4,096-row groups and −28% at 65,536-row groups, a table-level dictionary is a net *loss* (+1.6%), and PyArrow's 65,536-row groups save 1.4% of the file while raising the reader's peak from 13 MB to 57 MB, so the layout decision comes before the encoding; `harness/dict_survey.py` reproduces the tables and `write --snappy` output is within ±1.4% of PyArrow's plain output on the same rows (the seed, both layouts, the per-column deltas, the write/read times and the memory numbers are recorded) |
| R1 | Final 0.6.0 acceptance and release evidence | S0, E3, E4a, E4b, E4c, W0 | **Done** (verification §36): one candidate passes the whole list — check, format and interfaces clean, 340 native / 327 wasm-gc / 327 js tests, 75 Python self-tests, the 33 goldens on wasm-gc, native, js and through the release binary, the S0 differential plus window, pushdown, corpus, encoding, CLI, spill and writer gates, a 2,410,475,894-byte file round-tripping through three readers, and the packaged consumer pulling four shapes on three targets with fresh caches; the playground builds host-free and passes 16/16 in real Chromium; the performance pair is recorded beside a same-session 0.5.0 re-record; the eager shapes and platform limits are stated in `engine/stream.mbt`, §34 and the paragraph above. Push, tag, publication and deployment stay unauthorized release work |

**E3 contract.** Extend the ownership and early-stop rules in
`engine/stream.mbt` to the result boundary. `catalog.BatchStream` is an open
public trait; preserve external implementations when adding lifecycle behavior.
Specify exhaustion, early stop, repeated cleanup, query failure and consumer
failure, especially once a stream owns spill files. State which query shapes
stream and which use an eager fallback. Keep bind/type errors independent of
whether a LIMIT reads the tail. Define and test the CLI's partial-output behavior
when execution fails after rows have already been emitted, including its nonzero
exit status and error channel.

**Implementation entry points.** E3 started at `moonlake.mbt`,
`engine/engine.mbt`, `engine/stream.mbt`, `catalog/source.mbt` and
`cmd/main/main.mbt`; E4a added `streaming_agg_source`, `InputPull` (then named
`AggPull`) and `run_agg_pull` to `engine/stream.mbt`, dispatched from
`engine.mbt`, and folds through `engine/exec_agg.mbt`'s `aggregate_seq`. E4b
added `streaming_sort_source`, `sort_input`, `run_sort_pull` and
`ResultStream::sorted` there, `build_runs` and `MergeCursor` in
`engine/extsort.mbt`, and made a sorted stream the one stream that owns run
files; E4c started from `engine/exec_join.mbt`, `engine/extjoin.mbt`,
`engine/scan.mbt` and `engine/correlate.mbt`, and added
`JoinCursor` (also `join_step`'s engine, so one cursor serves both deliveries),
`streaming_join_source`, `JoinedPull` and `ResultStream::joined`. Grace
partitions keep their own path and are not fed incrementally: a two-table join
of the streamed shape never reaches them, while a chain of three or more still
does.
S0 starts from the cases documented in verification's pre-release user pass and
general decorrelation sections. W0 extended the measurements behind the writing
limit below with a structurally different table, and found that the row-group
size moves those numbers more than the encoding does (verification §35).

**Resource evidence.** Extend `harness/bench_early_stop.py` and the release
benchmark instead of relying on local-only probes. Record the source batch and
byte counts, first-result latency, total wall time, peak RSS, spill bytes and
result consumption separately. Measure the old collector, a batch consumer and
the CLI in isolated processes with stdout written to a file or sink. Compare
increasing input sizes with a fixed result or group count to expose retained
input. Performance comparisons need the same session, data hashes, toolchain,
build mode and answer oracle, plus a control run to identify machine noise.

W0 was a committed 0.6.0 investigation and it is answered in §35: on a second
table a per-column dictionary is worth −14% of the file at our current row-group
size and −28% at sixteen times fewer row groups, so the layout decision comes
first and dictionary implementation (W1) stays out of 0.6.0. When its trigger
below fires, W1 must bound dictionary memory, choose per column, fall back to
PLAIN when repetition does not pay, and preserve v1-page and reader
interoperability. A W0 result that does not justify the change completes the
investigation; it did not block 0.6.0 on a speculative encoding change.

Window functions, DISTINCT, set operations and derived queries may retain
documented eager paths in 0.6.0. A blocking operator can consume batches without
emitting its final answer early. Neither batch consumption nor a small
`--memory` value alone proves bounded total RSS. Broader SQL types, codecs,
optimizers, adapters and platform work still follow the triggers below.

## Known limits, and what closing each one means

The writer's 2 GiB file-offset limit was the first row here until 2026-10-24.
It is gone: page and column-chunk offsets are 64-bit, so a single page still has
to fit its 32-bit length field and a file no longer does. A 2.41 GiB file
written from CSV reads back identically in moonlake, pyarrow and DuckDB
([CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md), `harness/check_large_write.py`). What is still
refused:

| Limit today | Who runs into it | What a fix involves |
|---|---|---|
| wasm-gc and js scans read the whole file | Browser sessions over large CSVs or archives | Their filesystem module has no ranged read, so the fix starts upstream. `moonbitlang/async` already reads at a position, but only on native targets; the synchronous filesystem being built in `moonbitlang/x` does not carry one yet, and a wasm-gc version needs the runtime to export it as well. The browser playground has no filesystem at all and would keep using in-memory input either way. |
| The executor is not streaming end to end | Unrestricted results and queries with blocking operators | A single-table scan streams its result through `stream`/`stream_with`, and the CLI prints through it, so an unrestricted `WHERE`/projection result no longer holds its rows (verification §31: `--json` over 16 columns and 2,000,000 rows, 1,090.6 MB → 35.2 MB of peak RSS). A single-table aggregate folds the scan's batches as they arrive, so it holds its state and one batch rather than its input (verification §32: 109.7 MB → 35.3 MB). An `ORDER BY` under a budget merges its runs into batches instead of materializing the sorted answer (§33: 506.8 MB → 178.8 MB), and a two-table join probes a batch at a time with only its build side resident (§34: 270.8 MB → 35.3 MB). What still retains its input: a chain of three or more joins, a RIGHT/SEMI/ANTI join, a cross join, a budgeted `GROUP BY` (which collects to size its grace partitions), and any of ORDER BY, GROUP BY, DISTINCT or a window above a join. SF1 measured 159 MB for one projected column and 3.1 GB for all sixteen before any of this; §34 re-measures the join on a 16-column probe. See verification §25 for the eager measurements and §27 for the LIMIT comparison. |
| Reading is limited to flat schemas, v1 data pages, `INT32`/`INT64`/float/`STRING`/`DATE`/boolean, and the page encodings listed in the README; `DECIMAL`, `TIMESTAMP`, `INT96`, nested fields, v2 pages and the remaining codecs are refused with a pointed error | Producers that write those types | Each type or encoding needs the whole chain designed together: SQL type, CSV inference, Parquet read/write, spill format and JSON output. Starting with one of them alone tends to produce a value that is wrong somewhere later. |
| A non-equality correlation is answered by a nested loop | A correlated subquery whose predicate is not an equality over a large inner table | Keyless semi/anti joins test candidate inner rows; a scalar theta aggregate tests distinct outer combinations against inner rows. A range-aware or index-backed join needs a data layout that can answer the predicate without a scan. Start that optimization when a real query shows the cost. Verification §28 records the supported shapes and §30 the gate that now preserves their answers; §34 lists the join shapes that stay eager, and a semi/anti join is one of them (it is decorrelated into a scan first). |
| Spill reclamation declines to judge a directory it cannot prove is dead | A `--spill-dir` shared between containers, or a platform without `/proc` | Deliberate: a pid is only meaningful inside its own PID namespace, so the safe answer is to keep the directory and report it. Point each container at its own `--spill-dir`. |
| Writing is `PLAIN` values with v1 pages and one row group per 4,096-row batch; `--snappy` is the only compression choice | Output size for wide or repetitive columns | Measured on 6M SF1 rows: a per-column dictionary takes pyarrow's 288 MB to 196 MB (−32%) at no write- or read-time cost, and plain+zstd would reach 183 MB, but that needs a reader that accepts zstd. moonlake's own `--snappy` write is 289.2 MB for those rows: the 16% gap to pyarrow that this row used to name was one missing tag in the compressor (a short match close behind now costs two bytes, not three), so what is left is the dictionary, which is worth −32% and needs a per-column choice because it *grows* columns with no repetition. A second table (verification §35) prices both halves: on 500,000 rows of an access log the same per-column dictionary is worth −14% at our 4,096-row groups and −28% at 65,536-row groups, a dictionary on every column is 1.6% *larger* than plain, and the bigger group saves 1.4% of that file while costing the reader 13 MB → 57 MB of peak RSS. So the row-group size is the larger lever and the two decisions are not independent; `harness/dict_survey.py` regenerates the tables. |

## Candidates waiting for a trigger

These are not scheduled. Each one names the evidence that would start it, so a
reader can tell the difference between "not yet" and "no".

| Direction | What starts it |
|---|---|
| Cost-based optimization, automatic build-side choice | A profile showing the current plan choice is the hotspot at a realistic scale and selectivity. First step is a prototype that can be compared against the current planner on fixed queries. |
| Bit-packed validity, fewer join-time concatenations | An isolated benchmark showing a repeatable win; earlier experiments did not. |
| Adaptive dictionary write encodings, v2 pages, further codecs | The second table exists (verification §35) and it moved the first step: the encoding is worth −14% at our current row-group size and −28% at sixteen times fewer row groups, so what starts this is a decision to write larger row groups — a streaming writer change with its own read-memory cost — or an output-size complaint from a real producer whose columns are repetitive enough that a sixth of the file matters. Implementing the dictionary first would bank the smaller half of the same win. |
| `DECIMAL`, `TIMESTAMP`, explicit window frames | A semantic need with the full chain designed (see the limits table). |
| Arrow, a DataFrame API, JSONL, object storage | A real consumer and an interface contract. These stay separate adapters; the engine's own API is not a DataFrame. |
| Parallel execution, linear memory, cross-language benchmark suites | A target user and toolchain support for it. |
| Ranged reads on wasm-gc and js | Upstream exposing one: a single range-read method behind the existing file type, with the same contract the native binding keeps. `moonbitlang/async` shows the shape on native; the synchronous path and the wasm-gc/js runtime behind it are upstream's to build, so this direction waits rather than being worked on here. |

## What 0.6.0 had to clear

R1 started after the required implementation and investigation tasks above were
complete, and every item below passed on `3ab2634`; `verification.md` §36 is the
record, with the commands and the numbers. The list is kept in the past tense so
a reader can see what acceptance meant for this release:

- The manifest, library constant, generated interfaces, changelog and eventual
  tag agree on 0.6.0. Set the changelog's release date when the release happens.
- Check, format, interface freshness, the native/wasm-gc/js test suites and
  Python gate self-tests pass. Extend the independent archive consumer to use
  the new result API on all three targets, with fresh dependency caches.
- Golden queries pass on all three targets. `harness/check_all.sh` now takes
  `MOONLAKE_TARGET` (native, wasm-gc, js) and `MOONLAKE_BIN`, so the claim above
  is one script with three settings plus the built binary.
- The S0 differential, window and pushdown checks, Parquet corpus, encoding
  fixtures, CLI checks, spill lifecycle and writer interoperability pass. The
  real file-past-2-GiB check ran on the candidate; confirming the nightly job at
  the candidate's own SHA needs the authorized push, and its last green run is
  recorded as history rather than as acceptance.
- A complete 0.6.0 performance record is committed beside a same-session 0.5.0
  re-record (`bench-baseline.md`, last section). The LIMIT-specific records stay
  separate optimization evidence; no case changed its `sql` or its stdout hash,
  so the comparison is the same work, and the one real cost it shows is measured
  by an interleaved A/B.
- Check host-free wasm imports and drive the candidate playground in a real
  browser. After deployment, require the exact 0.6.0 version; after publication,
  run the registry consumer for 0.6.0. These are separate from local acceptance.

`moon publish --dry-run` uploads an archive, so it belongs to authorized release
work along with push, tag and publication. Current assessment and local
preparation do not perform those actions. [verification.md](verification.md)
records completed checks and their limits; a check on an earlier SHA is history,
not acceptance of the final candidate.

## How to move something up this page

Open an issue with the case that is expensive: the file (or its shape and size),
the query, and the number that matters — memory, wall time, or a file that
cannot be written at all. A limit with a reproduction beats a limit with a
theory.
